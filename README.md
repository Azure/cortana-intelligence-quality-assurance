The purpose of the project is a manufacturing solution template for predicting failures in manufacturing pipelines (assembly lines). We provide two deployment guidelines:

-  [step by step] (https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-quality-assurance-manufacturing/blob/master/StandAlone/README.md) deployment
-  one-button [click](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-quality-assurance-manufacturing/blob/master/CIQSDeployment/caqs-patterns/manufacturing/ManufacturingTemplateInstructions.md) experience. 

See [here](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-quality-assurance-manufacturing/blob/master/CIS_QAinManufacturing_BDM.md) an extended description of the solution.
