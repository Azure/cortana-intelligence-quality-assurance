## Manual Operation Instructions
1. Go [here]({Outputs.saJobOutputsUrl02}) to update the outputs. In each, then click on the __{Outputs.pbiOutputName}__  outputs, there are 5 in total, and then click on __Renew Authorization__ to set up authorization for Stream Analytics Power BI Output
2. To start/stop your Stream Analytics Job, you may use the START / STOP commands [here]({Outputs.saJobOutputsUrl02}) 
3. You can go to [Power BI Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) and use a Real-time dataset to build reports and dashboards using your data!
	- On the [Power BI Dashboard](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)  site locate the datasets produced by this pattern.
    - There are 5 Power BI Datasets generated by the Azure Stream Analytics job named waypoint0-waypoint4.
	- For each datasest
		- Click on the dataset name under __Datasets__
		- Under __Fields__ select the checkbox for ***device_id***
		- Under __Visualizations__ select ***Gauge***
		- Under the __File__ menu select ***Save As*** and name it with the name of the dataset (i.e. waypoint0-waypoint4)
		- Under __Reports__ click on the report created in the previous step
		- On the report, click on the Gauge then click the pin shaped icon 
			- If this is the first dataset, select ***New dashboard***, otherwise choose ***Existing dashboard*** and choose the dashboard you are creating.
		- For each query provided in the next step
			- Enter the query, from below, in the **Ask a question about your data** control
			- Expand the __Visualizations__ blade and click on format (shaped like a paint roller)
			- Turn on __Title__
			- Enter the description provided with the query
			- Click __Pin Visual__ in the upper right hand corner
		- Queries (where is the dataset you are working with)
			- How many device_id with label=1 in waypoint N in the last 30 seconds 
				- Description: 30 Second Success
			- How many device_id with label=-1 in waypoint N in the last 30 seconds 
				- Description: 30 Second Failure
			- device_id with label=-1 in waypoint 0 in the last 30 seconds
				- Description: Failed Product
			- device_id with label=1 in waypoint 0 in the last 30 seconds
				- Description: Successful Product
			
	
## Monitor the progress from
1. Web Jobs
	
	The production line data is generated by an Azure Web Job (of type Continuous). You can monitor this web job [here]({Outputs.webJobLogsUrl}).
		
2. Azure Event Hub
	    
    Azure Event Hub recieves all of the events sent by the continuous web job. You can monitor the hub activity by logging into the Azure Portal, locating the service bus namespace {Outputs.namespaceName} and finding 
	the event hub {Outputs.ingestEventHubName}.
	
3. ML WebService
	
    Five machine learning models are deployed as Azure WebServices and are consumed by the Azure Stream Analytics job.
	
	* You can view your machine learning web services by going [here](https://studio.azureml.net) and in the machine learning workspace {Outputs.mlWorkspaceId}.
